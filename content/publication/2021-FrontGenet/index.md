abstract: Animals, from insects to humans, exhibit obvious diurnal rhythmicity of feeding behavior. Serving as a genetic animal model, Drosophila has been reported to display feeding rhythms; however, related investigations are limited due to the lack of suitable and practical methods. Here, we present a video recording-based analytical method, namely, Drosophila Feeding Rhythm Analysis Method (dFRAME). Using our newly developed computer program, FlyFeeding, we extracted the movement track of individual flies and characterized their food-approaching behavior. To distinguish feeding and no-feeding events, we utilized high-magnification video recording to optimize our method by setting cut-off thresholds to eliminate the interference of no-feeding events. Furthermore, we verified that this method is applicable to both female and male flies and for all periods of the day. Using this method, we analyzed long-term feeding status of wild-type and period mutant flies. The results recaptured previously reported feeding rhythms and revealed detailed profiles of feeding patterns in these flies under either light/dark cycles or constant dark environments. Together, our dFRAME method enables a long-term, stable, reliable, and subtle analysis of feeding behavior in Drosophila. High-throughput studies in this powerful genetic animal model will gain great insights into the molecular and neural mechanisms of feeding rhythms.
