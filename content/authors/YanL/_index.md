We use Drosophila as animal model to explore the molecular mechanism of brain function, including neural developmental biology, molecular genetics, cognitive behavior of neural circuits etc. We will use the existing behavioral paradigm (eating, sleep and memory) as the basis to study effects of single genes on cell morphology, neural network, and the development of brain function.

1. The neural molecular mechanism of protein intake regulation
Feeding is one of the most conservative behaviors of living organisms. Although appetite signaling has been extensively studied, little is known about the mechanism of feeding ternmination. We firstly find the Drosophila protein specific satiety hormone - FIT, which is a kind of highly expressed gene in female fat body. As a secretory protein, FIT promotes insulin release in the Drosophila IPCs, thereby regulating the eating behavior. We screened 126 RNAi strains of GPCRs by behavioral experiments, and found that at least these three GPCRs were involved in protein intake. These studies reveal how nutrients can be perceived individually, and how the satiety signal is transmitted to the central nervous system.


2. Dendrite Development and Neurodegenerative Diseases
Dendrites are the major structure of neurons, which are responsible for receiving and integrating external info. We utilize the sensory neurons in Drosophila larvae to study the intracellular and extracellular factors in neurogenesis, polarization, and dendrite morphogenesis with genetic, molecular, and imaging approaches. We found that dendrites have directional growth like axons do, and epithelial derived Wingless signal plays essential role in dendrite patterning and efficient covering. We will continue to uncover the molecular pathway in dendrite routing, and to investigate its involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

3. The mechanism of memory decline in Drosophila melanogaster
AMI (Aging-related Memory Impairment), which is caused by aging, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in insects and mammals. Memory erasure is an inhibitory modification, which is caused by interference. It is not clear whether memory erasure is affected in older animals. Previous studies have shown that anesthesia sensitive memory is significantly reduced in the elder. Using a memory retrieval paradigm in Drosophila, we found that the anti anesthesia memory was selectively erased, while the anesthetic sensitive memory was not affected. After 3 hours of erasure, the erased memory of young flies completely recovered, but not in the old fruit flies. The lack of a more severe erasure and memory recovery after deletion resulted in memory decline in older fruit flies.

4. Neural Circus and Molecular Basis of Learning & Memory and Sleep
The Mushroom body (MB) is the brain center for olfactory learning & memory (L&M) as well as regulatory center of sleep in Drosophila. Our recent findings indicate that:
(1) There may have direct synaptic connection between the MB and the ellipsoid body (EB), one center for visual L&M, which could be the neural basis of cross-modal memory. We will further investigate the potential neural oscillation in memory consolidation.

(2) The core and surface regions of α/β MB lobes regulate sleep in opposite way, and both subgroups of neurons dependent on inhibitory Go signal and cholinergic output. Block Go signal can induce narcolepsy-like phenomenon in flies. It will be studied that whether these two adjacent subgroups are connected to each other, and whether this is the neural mechanism of sleep-wake switch.

(3) A pair of GABAergic APL neurons receives inhibitory regulation from dopaminergic neurons, and both of them project to the MB. This neural circuit ensures the efficient formation and regulation of a certain type of memory. Our next goal is to understand why this inhibitory regulation has such specificity, and whether it also crosstalks to another type of memory.

5．The neural mechanism of nicotine addiction
Short-term exposure to nicotine induces positive effects in mice, monkeys and humans. However, the underlying neural basis and molecular mechanisms for these effects remain poorly understood. Here, using a video recording system, we find that acute nicotine administration induces locomotor hyperactivity in Drosophila. Our results reveal that in fruit flies, dopaminergic neurons mediate nicotine-induced acute locomotor hyperactivity in a sexually dimorphic manner, and Drosophila β1 nAChR subunit plays a crucial role in this nicotine response. These findings provide important insights into the molecular and neural basis of acute nicotine effects, and the underlying mechanisms may play conserved roles across species.
