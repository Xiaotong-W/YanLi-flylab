# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: We use Drosophila as animal model to explore the molecular mechanism of brain function, including neural developmental biology, molecular genetics, cognitive behavior of neural circuits etc. We will use the existing behavioral paradigm (eating, sleep and memory) as the basis to study effects of single genes on cell morphology, neural network, and the development of brain function.

interests:
  - Neural mechanisms of feeding control and feeding rhythm.
  - Neural mechanisms of learning and memory.
  - Space hypomagnetic biology.
